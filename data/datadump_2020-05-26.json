Regulation O limits the amounts of loans that bank directors, shareholders, officers, and businesses owned by those persons can receive from their related banks and also imposes requirements for approval of insider loans by the bank\u2019s board of directors and the terms on which such loans may be extended. These requirements have prevented some small business owners from accessing PPP loans, especially in rural areas. The SBA recently clarified that PPP lenders can make PPP loans to businesses owned by their directors and certain shareholders, subject to certain limits and without favoritism. The change only applies to PPP loans. The rule change is effective immediately and will be in place while the PPP is active.",

This guidance identifies actions that financial institutions should take to minimize the potential adverse effects of a pandemic. Specifically, the institution\u2019s business continuity plan(s) (BCP) should address pandemics and provide for a preventive program, a documented strategy scaled to the stages of a pandemic outbreak, a comprehensive framework to ensure the continuance of critical operations, a testing program, and an oversight program to ensure that the BCP is reviewed and updated. The pandemic segment of the BCP must be sufficiently flexible to address a wide range of possible effects that could result from a pandemic and also be reflective of the institution\u2019s size, complexity, and business activities.",

The FDIC seeks to mitigate the deposit insurance assessment effects of participating in the PPP, PPPLF, and MMLF so that participating insured depository institutions (IDIs) would not be subject to increased deposit insurance assessments. Specifically the proposed rule would:\r\n1) remove the effect of participation in the PPP and PPPLF on various risk measures used to calculate an IDI's assessment rate; \r\n2) remove the effect of participation in the PPPLF and MMLF programs on certain adjustments to an IDI\u2019s assessment rate;\r\n3) provide an offset to an IDI\u2019s assessment for the increase to its assessment base attributable to participation in the MMLF and PPPLF; and \r\n4) remove the effect of participation in the PPPLF and MMLF programs when classifying IDIs as small, large, or highly complex for assessment purposes.\r\nThe FDIC is proposing an effective date of no later than 30-June-2020 and an application date of 1-April-2020, which would ensure that the changes are applied to assessments starting in the second quarter of 2020.

As a result, a person is deemed not to be providing remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of its business if such person provided 500 or fewer remittance transfers in the previous calendar year and provides 500 or fewer remittance transfers in the current calendar year. The final rule also adopts tailored exceptions to the Remittance Rule, including: \r\n(i) a new, permanent exception that permits insured institutions to estimate the exchange rate for a remittance transfer to a particular country if, among other things, the designated recipient will receive funds in the country\u2019s local currency and the insured institution made 1,000 or fewer remittance transfers in the prior calendar year to that country when the designated recipients received funds in the country\u2019s local currency, and \r\n(ii) a new, permanent exception that will permit insured institutions to estimate covered third-party fees for a remittance transfer to a designated recipient\u2019s institution if, among other things, the insured institution made 500 or fewer remittance transfers to that designated recipient\u2019s institution in the prior calendar year.
